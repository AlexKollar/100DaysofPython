#### A Portfolio of Python Programs  
I started the 100 days of code challenge because I wanted a structured means of learning python.  
However, I cant promise to commit to 100 consecutive days. I'm more or less using it for the structure as well as a portfolio.  
So this is still going to be 100 days of code. Just not in a row.
