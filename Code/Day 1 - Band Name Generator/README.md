# Day 1.) Band Name Generator
### Topics Covered:  
- Variables
- Errors and debugging
- String manipulation and concatination
- Gathering user input and adding it to a variable.
### Capstone Project:  
The main goal here was to creat a band name generator that took user inputs based on the town they grew up in and the name of a pet. Over all it worked out well. Simple first project. I'm sure as time goes on these readmes will get much more interesting.
