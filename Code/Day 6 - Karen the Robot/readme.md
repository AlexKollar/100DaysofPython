## Day 6 - Karen the Robot
### Topics Covered: 
#### Functions
We mostly use functions to make code more readable and less chaotic.  
Less Spaghetti and more nomnomnom ðŸ˜…
- Tere are two steps to make a function
- *def* the function with a name and end with a colon *:* 
- call the function later:   
```
Def printHello():  
print("Hello world!)  

#Sometime later in the code: 
printHello()
```   
#### Indentation  
Indentation plays a HUGE role in python. Think of it like the filestructure in your operating systems side bar. Your function acts as a folder and your code inside of the function acts as the files that would populate it. Sorta like this: 
```
Pictures>
-> Wallpapers
--> Nothing here
---> NO really
----> Nothing here
-----> Stoooopppp
------> .rule34
------> I told you. Nothing is here..  
If this looks confusion its an old meme about hiding your rule34. But if you replicated this in a linux system it would actually hide the rule34 folder due to the '.' in front. I'll let you figure out how to get it back...  
>! Ctrl+h (Linux) 
```
- While loops
